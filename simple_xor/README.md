## simple_xor
Open the simple_xor executable using ghidra or any other disassembler and look at the main function. The flag is of length 23 and the program xorres each character of the flag with its index and then compares it to ```gsgsGQ@|9gn8tRy>c\"Mk$gk```. To get the flag, xor each character of the ciphertext with its index.

flag: grepCTF{1nd3x_w1s3_x0r}
